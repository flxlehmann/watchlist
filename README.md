# Watchlists (Upstash + Next.js)

v15.5
- Moved **list ID** display next to the **Share link** (footer).
- **Removed seconds** from Updated / Last synced times (HH:MM only, locale-aware).
- **Add** button is now **44×44** (same height as inputs), still square and icon-centered.

Other features remain: posters, autocomplete, unified dark buttons with color-on-hover, animated watched progress.
