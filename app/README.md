# Watchlists (Upstash + Next.js)

v15.8
- View toggle button is now **blue role** and appears in **header AND toolbar** for visibility.
- Autocomplete dropdown now has **width:100%** and higher **z-index** to ensure it exactly matches the movie input and overlays other content.

If you still don't see the toggle, confirm you're on a list page (toggle only renders when a list is active).
