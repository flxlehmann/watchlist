# Watchlists (Upstash + Next.js)

v15.6
- **Autocomplete dropdown** now anchors to the movie input and matches its width.
- Added **Grid View** with a **view switch** in the header (icons: list ↔ grid).
- All existing styles remain (dark buttons, color-on-hover, posters, animated watched progress).

Tip: The chosen view is remembered in localStorage.
