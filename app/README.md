# Watchlists (Upstash + Next.js)

v15.7
- Fix: replaced mistaken JSX `and` with `&&` to resolve "Unexpected token `div`" build error.
- Keep **grid/list toggle**, **anchored autocomplete**, **hover-color buttons**, **animated progress**, **posters**.

**Important**: place this folder at project root and keep the page at `app/page.tsx` (not `app/app/page.tsx`).
